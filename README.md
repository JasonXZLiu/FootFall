# FootFall

A website for the 2017 SHAD John Dobson Entrepreneurship Cup. This year, the theme was, "How can Canadians meaningfully reduce our
individual energy footprints, to achieve a significant collective impact?". With this question, our team, from SHAD Queens, came up with FootFall, a company creating a comprehensive piezoelectric tile that could generate electricity, relaying valuable data to customers such as malls, airports, and stores.
